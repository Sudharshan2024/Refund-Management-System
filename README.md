##Introduction
- In this project, I developed a Refund Management System backend application using Spring Boot.
- The system allows users (or admin interfaces) to manage refund records — creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving refund information stored in an Oracle Database.
- This project demonstrates backend development, REST API creation, validation, exception handling, and database persistence using Spring Data JPA.

##Objective
- Build a Spring Boot backend module to manage customer refunds.
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Integrate with Oracle Database for persistence using Spring Data JPA.
- Apply validation and exception handling for robust backend operation.
- Test all APIs using Postman for smooth client-server interaction.
